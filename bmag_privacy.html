			<p>We welcome and encourage open discussion on ARTS – including but not limited to our 'അ' Hyderabad, 
      'അ' Library , 'അ' Avishkara, 'അ' Palette, and Kayyoppu – and look forward to any comments, stories, 
      pictures, and experiences you want to share. That said, we do make reasonable efforts to monitor 
      participation to ensure that you stay on topic, are courteous, and avoid making offensive comments. 
      Please be aware that once you post something online, there’s the potential for thousands 
      (or hundreds of thousands) of people to read your words, even years from now.</p>
      <p>The opinions and views expressed on ARTS platforms, including, but not limited to, our above cited groups, 
      represent the thoughts of individual contributors and online communities, and not those necessarily of 
      ARTS or 'അ'  or any of their respective members or board of Administrators. The opinions and views 
      expressed on these pages do not in any way reflect the views of the groups they are posted on, other 
      groups affiliated with the App, the staff involved with maintaining the site or any members of the App.</p>
      <p>While ARTS or 'അ' makes reasonable efforts to monitor and/or moderate content posted on its social 
      media platforms, we do not moderate all comments and cannot always respond in a timely manner to online 
      requests for information. ARTS or 'അ'  reserves the sole right to review, edit and/or delete any comments 
      it deems are inappropriate. Comments including but not limited to the following may be deleted or edited by the moderators:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>1. Abusive or hurtful comments about a post or another participant</li>
      <li>2. Off-topic and redundant comments (this includes promotion of events, groups, pages, websites, organizations and programs not related to or affiliated with the organization)</li>
      <li>3. Comments that use foul language or “hate speech” (for example, including but not limited to racial, ethnic or gender bashing language)</li>
      <li>4. Personal attacks or defamatory statements or comments (i.e., making negative personal or untrue comments about a participant), instead of just criticizing his/her posting, opinion or comments.</li>
      <li>5. All links to other websites found linked from ARTS App are provided as a service to readers, but such linkage does not constitute endorsement of those sites by Community Servings, and as such we are not responsible for the content of external websites.</li>

      <p>By submitting content to any of ARTS or 'അ' groups, you understand and acknowledge that this information 
	      is available to the public, and that ARTS or 'അ' may use this information for internal and external promotional 
	      purposes and fundraising purposes. Please note that other participants may use your posted information beyond
